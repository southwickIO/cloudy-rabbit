    • detecting ip spoofing:
        ◦ compare ttl of packets of valid conversations with suspect packets 
            ▪ (must be routed packets and path must be symmetrical)
        ◦ ip-id check
            ▪ send packet to source of suspect packet
            ▪ response ipid in response should be near, and greater than, the suspect packet
        ◦ tcp flow control
            ▪ attacker cannot see syn/ack and adjust data size based on window size
            ▪ advertize a window of 0 in Syn/ACK and if the sender sends data back, after you advertized against it, its a good chance that is a spoofed ip

    • protecting against spoofing:
        ◦ filter icmp
        ◦ use random initial sequence numbers
        ◦ block bogons
            ▪ A bogon is a term used to refer to an IP address or network that is invalid, non-routable, or otherwise not recognized by the internet routing system.
        ◦ do not base authentication on ip
        ◦ reduce initial ttls
        ◦ acl filter inbound traffic from subnets
        ◦ acl egress filter traffic from your network destined for your network
