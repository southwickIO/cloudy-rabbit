Detecting HTTP tunneling can be challenging, as it involves encapsulating one protocol (such as VNC) within another protocol (HTTP), making it difficult to detect using traditional network monitoring techniques. However, there are several methods that can be used to detect HTTP tunneling:

Protocol analysis: One way to detect HTTP tunneling is to analyze the network traffic for signs of HTTP protocol violations. HTTP tunneling may cause anomalies in the HTTP protocol, such as unusual message sizes, unusual sequence of packets, or unusual HTTP headers, which can be detected using network protocol analyzers like Wireshark.

Anomaly detection: Another method is to use anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns of traffic on the network. For example, if a large amount of HTTP traffic is being sent between two hosts, but there is no corresponding HTTP service running on either host, it may be a sign of HTTP tunneling.

Port scanning: HTTP tunneling typically involves using non-standard ports, such as port 80 or 443, to bypass firewalls and other security measures. Performing port scans can help identify open ports on a network, which may indicate the presence of HTTP tunneling.

Content filtering: HTTP tunneling may involve transmitting data in non-standard formats or using unusual encoding methods. Content filtering tools can be used to inspect the contents of HTTP traffic for signs of tunneling, such as base64-encoded data or binary data embedded in HTTP packets.
